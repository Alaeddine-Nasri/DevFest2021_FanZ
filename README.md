# Our Project
 - Our solution, & through a camera integrated in the home TV allows to recognize the child and it's inputted age who is watching & then notifies the parent in case the content he is viewing is unfitting, In addition if the camera detects that the kid is at a close distance from the TV screen that might hurt his sight, it blurs out the screen & displays through animations that he is too close & should stand back to clear the screen again.

## AI MODELS
 - we used computer vision services provided by azure cognitive services to deploy an AI model that allows to do facial recognition & associate it with it's input age, and then through the metadata of the current show.

### Distance Detection Model
